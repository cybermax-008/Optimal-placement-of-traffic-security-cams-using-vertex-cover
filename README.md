# Optimal placement of traffic security cameras using Vertex cover algorithms  
  
This work belongs to the coursework done by me for, ECE650: Methods and Tools for software Engineering, University of Waterloo.  
**Languages used:**  
- Python 3
- C++  
## Overview
The project is to help the local police department with their installation of security cameras at traffic intersections.
You will solve a particular kind of optimization problem, called the Vertex Cover problem, in this
context. The idea is for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need to
install, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring.  
  
*The entire project is approched with a series of assignments.*
